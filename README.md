# 🧠 Employee Promotion Classification

### 📋 About the Project  
This project aims to build a **classification model** that predicts whether an employee will be promoted based on various factors such as age, experience, job role, salary, and performance score.  
But that is not important to us, its the **PREPROCESSING**.
The dataset used in this notebook is **synthetically generated** to resemble a real-world HR dataset — complete with missing values and outliers to make the analysis more realistic.  

The workflow covers **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning model building** using scikit-learn.

### 🧩 Key Features
- ✅ Synthetic dataset generation using **NumPy** and **Pandas**  
- 🧹 Handling **missing values** and **outliers**  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- 🔠 Encoding and scaling of features  
- 🤖 Building classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
- 📈 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
